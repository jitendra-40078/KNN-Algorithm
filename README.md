Diabetes Prediction KNN model
# Description:
## KNN Algorithm
KNN: K Nearest Neighbor is one of the fundamental algorithms in machine learning. Machine learning models use a set of input values to predict output values. KNN is one of the simplest forms of machine learning algorithms mostly used for classification. It classifies the data point on how its neighbor is classified.
## Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
#Problem Statement
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
